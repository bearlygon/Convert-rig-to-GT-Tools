# GT-Tools-Bonus
These scripts are my workflow base on https://github.com/TrevisanGMW/gt-tools for convert mixamo or accurig to native gt tools rig and https://joaen.gumroad.com/l/ktpvZ for batch export retarget animation to .anim (gt-tools) or fbx.
# Discription
The scripts is using GT Tools biped rigger, export/import weight map (built-in maya), mixamo auto-rigger or accurig auto rigger to function. Only works with humanoid rig type.

<b>This scripts is written by chatgpt through try and error because i don't know how to code, i do test it many times before posted here, but there is no guaranteed you will not encounter any error, if you do so, please restart the code or maya, if it still not working, please re-install maya. You could sumbit the error so i could look into it and fix it (not really sure i could fix or not, but i will try).</b>

<b>These scripts are using shelf button, so i will pack the scripts with .txt format instead of .py format</b>
